Our GUI methods are defined in the Test.java class. 
Run as a 'Java Application' and new window should appear on the screen.
The default size of the window is: 960 X 540.
If there are any issues regarding the size of the window, it is re-sizable.

***Navigating the Application***
The Menu Bar has 3 Options: 
1. File
	1a. Set Escape Distance: 
		Allows the user to set the Escape Distance for every fractal at the same time.
		Only a positive number is accepted.
	1b. Exit: 
		Exits the Application.
2. Fractal
	2a. Burning Ship Fractal: Selects the Burning Ship Fractal to be displayed.
	2b. Julia Fractal: Selects the Julia Fractal to be displayed.
	2c. Mandelbrot Fractal: Selects the Mandelbrot Fractal to be displayed.
	2d. Multibrot Fractal: Selects the Multibrot Fractal to be displayed.
3. Color
	3a. Blue: 
		Colors every fractal BLUE.
	3b. Gray: Colors every fractal GRAY.
	3c. Green: Colors every fractal GREEN.
	3d. Purple: Colors every fractal PURPLE.
	3e. Rainbow: Colors every fractal RAINBOW.
	3f. Red: Colors every fractal RED.
	3g. Turquoise: Colors every fractal TURQUOISE.
	
***Using the Application***
1. File --> Set Escape Distance
	A separate window will pop up asking for input. 
	Follow the directions on screen.
	An error message pops up if the directions are not followed. 
2. Fractal --> Burning Ship, Julia, Mandelbrot, Multibrot
	Clicking on a fractal will display the fractal on the screen AFTER the Escape Distance has been inputed.
	A Fractal will display only if the Escape Distance is 2 or greater.
3. Color --> Blue, Gray, Green, Purple, Rainbow, Red, Turquoise
	Clicking on a color will change the color of the fractal selected.
	Selecting a fractal after selecting a color will display that fractal with the color selected. 
	
Notes:
	The Escape Distance can be changed at anytime.
	A fractal can be selected at anytime.
	A color can be selected at anytime. 
	Whenever an Escape Distance, fractal, or color is chosen, ALL fractals are updated and the current fractal
		selected will reflect that as well as choosing another fractal.
